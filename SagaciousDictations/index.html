            <p> <em> Sagacious dictations</em> is a place to voice opinions, share proven, researched ideas/thoughts, and get involved in this political process.  This endeavor invites any and all that desire to participate and to draw an audience with an awareness of current events, politics, civics, people, and an extremely flexible sense of humor or not</p>
            <br>
            <p>The political scene is explosive, as of late. Kamala Harris lady has everybody’s attention, including the billionaires.  But, if she doesn’t play her cards right and the Democrats play the revenge card, we’re in trouble.  Right now, those novices in Congress ought to be scrambling for a mentor instead of as Peter Brokaw put it, <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/brokaw-blames-both-parties-for-shutdown-knocks-young-dems-running-through-the-halls/" cite="https://freebeacon.com/politics/brokaw-blames-both-parties-for-shutdown-knocks-young-dems-running-through-the-halls/">“…running through the halls of Congress having a pep rally!”</a> </p>
            <br>
            <p>This dance that Trump is doing is nothing new.  When I watch him, it takes me back to schoolyard antics and people not wanting to get involved. Because I have been around so long, some of what I see, read, hear about is like déjà vu. </p>

                <p>While watching the Senate hearings today with Michael Cohen on the stand and testifying as to his involvement in the cover-up orchestrated by D. Trump.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Michael Cohen has been in the hot seat and under some very tenuous questioning from the entire congressional population in D.C.  This is to corroborate his earlier statements, be in agreement with his testimony at his hearing, and clear his name of Trump’s misbehavior and law breaking.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bottom line is voting matters.  Your <strong>vote matters</strong>.  My vote matters.  If the numbers of registered voters that voted had not voted, we would not be looking at this cancer that has overcome our political system.  We would have had a cover-up of massive proportions and the criminal activity taking place at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would have gone unnoticed and unaccounted for.  We have a real gangster in the WH, running our country as if it’s one of his businesses, and calling all the shots.  In other words, “Do as I say and not as I do!”</p>

                <div class="circle" id="representative"></div>
                <p>Because the newly elected officials are representative of a wave of women, non-Trump supporters, and a repositioning of persons’ opinions that were formerly Trump supporters, there has been a shakeup in DC.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The lesson = Do not forego your constitutional right to cast your vote for your chosen candidate.  It further takes us to task to do our part in making the decision based upon their campaign promises, their availability, and their dedication to their constituency, and most of all – refusing to use their office and their power to further their own personal agenda for profit and/or notoriety.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We must vow to hold our elected representatives <u>responsible and accountable</u>!!!</p>

                    <p>	When we enter the educational system, we expect to exit after being thoroughly prepared to conquer the world.  We have before us at least twelve years of reading, grammar, mathematics, science, writing, social studies, geography, social etiquette (that is, how to get along with each other).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>	Now, the problem with this is the subjects and the curriculum are not addressing the institution of learning that is currently in effect.  Why?  Do we really know why and how do we fix it?</p>

                    <div class="circle" id="children"></div>
                    <p>	My task here is to bring to the forefront of the minds of interested individuals and those who are willing to listen, learn, and participate, this broken educational system we have cultivated and what are our next steps to ‘fix’ it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>	I am a septuagenarian and my experience with the educational system is probably light years away from most of my readers.</p>

                <div class="blog-post">
                    <p>I am totally impressed with AOC.  However, she is pushing the envelope at a rate that may result in burnout on her part.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I read today that she is paying her interns (known as newbies back in the day) at a rate of $52K per year.  I am questioning this decision because it sends the wrong message and that message is that you don’t have to earn your pay, you don’t have to be an understudy in order to improve, you don’t have to have any seniority or experience under your belt – you are privileged to be in the employ of a person that has this plan to do IT differently.  I think it’s a decision that will serve to bite her in the butt because I don’t care where you’re from or where you’re going.  If you’ve been on a job or held a position for a while, you expect certain perks.  It could be an annual raise, paid vacation, compensatory time, bonuses, et. al.  It is not practicing good human resource standards to pay someone with little or no experience more than your experienced, senior personnel.</p>
                    <br>
                    <div class="circle" id="cortez"></div>
                    <p>It is a well-known fact that airline pilots are routinely retired when they reach a certain age.  However, Captain Sully was beyond retirement age when he so confidently set a plane down in the Hudson River and suffered no casualties.  He could do that because he had recently completed a course on landing in water and he had enough experience under his belt to know what action to take to save the lives of his passengers.  I will be willing to bet all I have that a novice pilot would not have had the acumen, nerve, or skill to complete the landing safely.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now, before I go completely off my rocker, I will have to complete some in depth research on her, her background, her affiliations, and ultimately her vision for the people in her district.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am addressing just one facet of this dilemma and I trust AOC will take this for the encouragement and advisement it was meant to be.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I believe she has fire in her belly and she is going to be a force to be reckoned with.  BUT, she’s a kid in the big league.  She should learn the rules before she begins to attempt to change them.  There are people on Capitol Hill that are more than willing to mentor, guide, assist, share…  She just needs to be open to their expertise and their cavernous wisdom.</p>
